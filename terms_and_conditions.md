# **Terms and Conditions**

Last updated: February 7, 2020

Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms" or "Terms and Conditions") carefully before using the [poster.jellypbc.com](https://poster.jellypbc.com) website operated by Jelly Labs PBC ("Jelly", us", "we", or "our"). For purposes of these Terms, “you” and “your” means you as the user of the Service.

Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned upon your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who wish to access or use the Service.

By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you do not have permission to access the Service. If you are accessing or using the Service on behalf of a business or entity, then your business or entity is legally and financially responsible for your access to and use of the Service as well as for the use of your account by others affiliated with your entity, including any employees, agents or contractors.

## 1. **Content**

Our Service allows you to post, link, store, share and otherwise make available certain information, text, graphics, videos, or other material ("Content") on the Service. You are responsible for the Content that you post on or through the Service, including its legality, reliability, and appropriateness.

By posting Content on or through the Service, You represent and warrant that: (a) the Content is yours and/or you have the right to use it and the right to grant us the rights and license as provided in these Terms, and (b) that the posting of your Content on or through the Service does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights or any other rights of any person or entity. We reserve the right to terminate the account of anyone found to be infringing on a copyright.

You retain any and all of your rights to any Content you submit, post or display on or through the Service and you are responsible for protecting those rights; except that if you submit or post Enterprise Content (as defined below) to an Enterprise Workspace (as defined below), then the ownership of such Enterprise Content will be as set forth in any agreement between you and the applicable Enterprise (as defined below) that manages such Enterprise Workspace, and in the absence of such agreement, then as between you and such Enterprise, the Enterprise will own all rights to any such Enterprise Content.

However, users can still create, join and use their own Personal Workspaces or Team Workspaces separately from use of Enterprise Workspaces. Content uploaded to a Personal Workspace or Team Workspace remains owned by the user and not the Enterprise.

We take no responsibility and assume no liability for Content you or any third-party posts on or through the Service. When you post Content into certain Workspaces, you will be able to designate whether such Content is made publicly or privately available.

As a condition of your use of the Service, you grant Jelly a nonexclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, worldwide, transferable, sub-licenseable license to access, use, host, cache, store, reproduce, transmit, display, publish, distribute, modify and adapt and create derivative works (either alone or as part of a collective work) from your Content. As part of the foregoing license grant you agree that (a) the other users of the Service shall have the right to comment on and/or tag your public Content that you make available to them and/or to use, publish, display, modify or include a copy of your public Content that you make available to them, and (b) we have the right to make any of your public Content available to third parties, so that those third parties can distribute, make derivative works of, comment on and/or analyze your Content on other media and services (either alone or as part of a collective work); except that the foregoing (a) and (b) shall not apply to any of your Content that you post privately for non-public display on the Service.

By posting Content that is set for public access to the Service, you grant us the right to display such public Content on and through the Service. Jelly has the right but not the obligation to monitor all Content provided by users.

In addition, any Content found on or through this Service that is not originally submitted, posted, or displayed by users of the Service is the property of Jelly or used with permission. You may not distribute, modify, transmit, reuse, download, repost, copy, or use said Content, whether in whole or in part, for commercial purposes or for personal gain, without express advance written permission from us.

You agree that Jelly has the right, but not the obligation, to remove any Content from the Service if Jelly determines in its sole discretion that such Content has violated these Terms, applicable law, or the privacy rights, publicity rights, intellectual property, contract rights or any other rights of any person or entity, or if Jelly determines in its sole discretion that such Content poses a risk of harm to Jelly, other users of the Service or third parties.

Any content stored on the Service will be stored indefinitely, unless it is explicitly deleted or unless otherwise set forth in a separate agreement with an Enterprise (as defined below). This process is described under "Termination".

## 2. **Workspaces**

Content submitted, posted or modified by users in the Service is organized into separated sections we refer to as “Workspaces.”

There are three general types of Workspaces on the Service:

- “Personal Workspaces” that can only be accessed by the user that created the Workspace.
- “Team Workspaces” that require a Team Subscription (as defined below) and that can be accessed by multiple users that form the members of the Team. Further details on Team Workspaces are outlined below.
- “Enterprise Workspaces” that require an Enterprise Subscription (as defined below) and that are designed for large-scale usage by Enterprises who require tools managing all Content within such Workspaces. Further details on Enterprise Workspaces are outlined below.

In the Service, you can work across multiple Workspaces at once, meaning your single account can access your own Personal Workspace(s), different Team Workspace(s), and your employer’s Enterprise Workspace. Workspaces are completely separate, and you won’t be able to link any Content between them (although you can transfer copies of Content from one Workspace to another). You can also export your Content from your Workspaces for use outside of the Service using our export tool available in our online account management page. Note that exporting or transferring Content from an Enterprise’s Workspace will be managed by the applicable Enterprise administrator, which may or may not allow you to use our export or transfer tools for Content from such Enterprise’s Workspace.

## 3. **Subscriptions**

Some parts of the Service are made available on a paid subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). Subscriptions are available for Personal Workspaces, Team Workspaces and Enterprise Workspaces. Pricing for the Subscriptions is set forth here: [https://poster.jellypbc.com/pricing](https://poster.jellypbc.com/pricing).

You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing Cycles are set on a monthly or yearly basis. Whether you are using monthly or yearly billing, your account may be charged on a monthly basis.

Auto-Renewal: You agree that at the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew and your payment method for such Subscription will automatically be charged at the start of each new Subscription period for the fees and taxes applicable to that Billing Cycle, under the same conditions as the prior Billing Cycle unless you cancel it or Jelly cancels it.

A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You must provide Jelly with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Jelly to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.

Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Jelly may attempt to charge the credit card on file one or more times. Should payment continue to fail, the Subscription will be cancelled.

You may cancel your Subscription through contacting Jelly customer support team at [founders@jellypbc.com](mailto:founders@jellypbc.com).

## 4. **Team Subscriptions and Team Workspaces**

Jelly offers “Team Workspaces” that can be accessed by multiple team members. To create a Team Workspace, you will need to purchase a “Team Subscription”.

Team Subscriptions are charged on a per member and per Team Workspace basis. That means if the same member is accessing two different Team Workspaces, then two different Subscription fees will be charged for that user accessing both Team Workspaces. For example, if you are buying a Subscription for two separate Team Workspaces with 4 members in each Team Workspace on a monthly Team Subscription of $10 per member, that would be charged as $10 x 8 members or $80/month. If two of those members are overlapping in both Team Workspaces, that would still be charged as $80/month.

Certain sections of a Team Workspace will be designated as accessible by all members of the Team. Any Content posted to those sections of a Team Workspace will be accessible by all members of the Team Workspace. If a member of a Team Workspace terminates the Service account or ceases to be a member of the Team Workspace, their Content posted to those accessible sections of the Team Workspace will not be removed and will remain accessible by other member of the Team Workspace.

Members of a Team Workspace can also designate that certain sections of the Team Workspace are private only to that member. Any Content posted by such member to the private sections of the Team Workspace will be accessible only by that member. If a member of the Team Workspace terminates their Service account or ceases to be a member of the Team Workspace, any of their Content posted to those private sections will be removed and not accessible by any other members of the Team Workspace.

## 5. **Enterprise Subscriptions and Enterprise Workspaces**

Jelly offers “Enterprise Workspaces” on the Service that are designed for use by enterprises, employers and other organizations that have multiple teams and require collaborative Workspaces with higher levels of support, controls and unlimited revision history for all pages. Enterprise Workspaces are not for personal use, but are only available to organizations (such as an employer or another business entity) or their authorized representatives.

To create an Enterprise Workspace, the applicable organization will need to purchase an “Enterprise Subscription.” An organization that has purchased an Enterprise Subscription will be referred to herein as an “Enterprise”. An Enterprise Subscription can be purchased either directly within the Service interface (in which case their use will be governed by these Terms) or by entering into a separate service agreement, subscription agreement, order form, or similar agreement with Jelly. In the event of a conflict between these Terms and such separate agreement with Jelly, the terms of such separate agreement will supersede and control with respect to any use of the Enterprise Workspaces of that applicable Enterprise.

An Enterprise may invite you to use their Enterprise Workspace or join the Service as their Enterprise User by sending you an invite link that allows you to create an account on the Service and gain access to the applicable Enterprise Workspaces.

As stated in the “Content” section of these Terms, if you submit or post Content to an Enterprise Workspace (such Content, the “Enterprise Content”), then the ownership of such Enterprise Content will be as set forth in any agreement between you and the applicable Enterprise (as defined below) that manages such Enterprise Workspace, and in the absence of such agreement, then as between you and such Enterprise, the Enterprise will own all rights to any such Enterprise Content that is submitted, posted, stored or made available on its Enterprise Workspace.

We provide an Enterprise with many other tools and controls over an Enterprise Workspace and Enterprise Content. For example, an Enterprise may access, delete, edit or export Enterprise Content; enable or disable an Enterprise User’s access to an Enterprise Workspace; grant access to Enterprise Content to third parties; enable or disable third party integrations; manage an Enterprise User’s permissions, retention and export settings; and these choices and instructions may result in the access, use, disclosure, modification or deletion of certain or all Enterprise Content.

Enterprises are authorized to add and remove users to use their unique Enterprise Workspaces. Users that have been authorized to use an Enterprise Workspace of the Service by an Enterprise are referred to as an “Enterprise User” while they are using such Enterprise Workspace. If you purchased an Enterprise Subscription on behalf of your organization or employer, your organization or employer is the Enterprise, and not you. The Enterprise can modify and re-assign roles on the Enterprise Workspace (including your role). If the Enterprise elects to replace you as the representative with ultimate authority for the Enterprise Workspace, you agree to take any actions reasonably requested by us or the Enterprise to facilitate the transfer of authority to a new representative of the Enterprise.

If you are using an Enterprise Workspace as an Enterprise User, then you agree that as between Jelly and Enterprise, it is Enterprise’s responsibility to (a) inform you as an Enterprise User of any relevant Enterprise policies and practices that may impact the use and processing of your Enterprise Content; and (b) obtain any rights, permissions or consents from you as an Enterprise User that are necessary for the lawful use of your Enterprise Content. Further, if you are using an Enterprise Workspace as an Enterprise User, you acknowledge that the Service as used by you under such circumstances is a workplace tool intended for use by businesses and organizations and not for consumer purposes. To the maximum extent permitted by law, you hereby acknowledge and agree that consumer laws do not apply in connection with such use of an Enterprise Workspace as an Enterprise User.

## 6. **Referrals and Credit**

Your account with the Service can accrue credits in a variety of ways (“Account Credits”), for example by referring new users to the Service (“Referral Program”). Account Credits can only be used to offset your Service’s Subscription fees.

**Referral Program**. You can earn Account Credits by inviting new users to the Service. You will be assigned a personal referral link for referring such new users that can be found at the Earn Credit tab in your account settings page (“Personal Referral Link”). To participate in the Referral Program, you may refer new users who have not previously opened an account on the Service by sending them your Personal Referral Link via email, by tweeting your Personal Referral Link, or by copying your Personal Referral Link and sending it yourself. When a new user signs up and opens a Service account via your Personal Referral Link, both you and the new user will receive Account Credits redeemable to offset Subscription fees.

You and your referred new user will receive the Account Credits amount specified on our Pricing page at the time of the referral. The Account Credits will be credited to your respective Service accounts after your referred new user signs up and opens a Service account via your Personal Referral Link. The maximum total of Account Credits you may receive under the Referral Program is $200.00 (“Account Credit Limit”). Once the Account Credit Limit has been reached, you will no longer receive any Account Credits for referrals. For Account Credits to apply, you must have a paid Subscription or first upgrade to a paid Subscription. If you already have a paid Subscription, you may apply Account Credits to the next payment due in your Billing Cycle. If you are upgrading to a paid Subscription, Account Credits may be applied to your new paid Subscription.

To qualify for Account Credits via the Referral Program, the referred new user must (i) be a new Service user that has never created an account on the Service before, (ii) use a Personal Referral Link to sign up for a new Service account. Referring new Service users may not collect referrals by:

- self-referring by using multiple or false names, identities, accounts or email addresses;
- referring anyone who is an existing Service user, including an existing user with an account under an alternate email address;
- using spam or sending unsolicited emails to persons they don’t personally know to collect referrals, or otherwise violating any applicable law, rule, regulation or third party terms of use;
- posting on message boards, public forums, coupon sites or other online venues (such as coupon websites, reddit, or Wikipedia);
- permitting another individual to use the referring user’s account;
- referring fake people to the Service, impersonating another person, or otherwise providing Jelly with false or misleading information;
- using the Personal Referral Link in any manner that is disparaging or that otherwise portrays Jelly or the Service in a negative light; or
- any other restriction we impose on participants in our Referral Program in our discretion upon prior notice.

By acquiring Account Credits, you agree and acknowledge that we are granting you a limited, revocable license to a digital item, and that the Account Credits are not your personal property. Except as explicitly provided herein, your Personal Referral Link and Account Credits are non-transferable. Account Credits cannot be applied to previous purchases and are not redeemable for cash. All Account Credits are voided immediately upon termination of our Referral Program. We reserve the right to suspend or cancel accounts or remove Account Credits in our sole discretion if we notice any activity that we believe is abusive or fraudulent.

## 7. **Free Trial**

Jelly may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time ("Free Trial"). If you are on a Free Trial, you may cancel at any time until the last day of your Free Trial by following the cancellation procedures outlined in the Subscription section of these Terms. If you or Jelly cancel your Free Trial, you acknowledge and agree that we may delete all of your content or data associated with the Workspace that was assigned to your Free Trial. If you do not cancel your Free Trial, then your Free Trial will be converted to a paid Subscription at the end of the trial period, and you hereby authorize us to charge your credit card or other payment method for continued use of the paid Service under such Subscription. You may then however, cancel your Subscription in accordance with the Subscription section of these Terms.

At any time and without notice, Jelly reserves the right to (a) modify the terms and conditions of any Free Trial offer, (b) cancel any Free Trial offer, or (c) cancel any Free Trial subscription at any time.

## 8. **Fees and Fee Changes**

Jelly, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.

Jelly will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.

Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.

Fees are stated exclusive of any taxes or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, for example, value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction (collectively, “Taxes”). You will be responsible for paying all Taxes associated with your Subscription, except for those taxes based on our net income. Should any payment for the Service be subject to withholding tax by any government, you will reimburse us for such withholding tax.

## 9. **Refunds**

Payment obligations are non-cancelable, and fees paid are non-refundable and there are no credits for partially used Subscription periods.

Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by Jely on a case-by-case basis and granted in sole discretion of Jelly.

## 10. **Communications from Jelly**

By creating an account on our Service, you agree to subscribe to newsletters or marketing materials and other promotional information we may send. However, you may opt out of receiving any, or all, of these marketing communications from us by following the unsubscribe link or instructions provided in any email we send. Please note that we may still send you transactional or administrative messages related to the Service even after you have opted out of receiving marketing communications.

You are responsible for providing the mobile device, wireless service plan, software, Internet connections and/or other equipment or services that you need to download, install and use any mobile application versions of the Service (the “App”). We do not guarantee that the App can be accessed and used on any particular device or with any particular service plan. We do not guarantee that the App will be available in any particular geographic location. As part of the Service and to update you regarding the status of deliveries, you may receive push notifications, local client notifications, text messages, picture messages, alerts, emails or other types of messages directly sent to you in connection with the App (“Push Messages”). You acknowledge that, when you use the App, your wireless service provider may charge you fees for data, text messaging and/or other wireless access, including in connection with Push Messages. You have control over the Push Messages settings and can opt in or out of these Push Messages through the Service or through your mobile device’s operating system (with the possible exception of infrequent, important service announcements and administrative messages). Please check with your wireless service provider to determine what fees apply to your access to and use of the App, including your receipt of Push Messages from Jelly. You are solely responsible for any fee, cost or expense that you incur to download, install and/or use the App on your mobile device, including for your receipt of push messages from Jelly.

Mobile Software from the Apple App Store. The following terms and conditions apply to you only if you are using the App from the Apple App Store. To the extent the other terms and conditions of these Terms are less restrictive than, or otherwise conflict with, the terms and conditions of this paragraph, the more restrictive or conflicting terms and conditions in this paragraph apply, but solely with respect to the App from the Apple App Store. You acknowledge and agree that these Terms are solely between you and Jelly, not Apple, and that Apple has no responsibility for the App or content thereof. Your use of the App must comply with the App Store’s applicable terms of use. You acknowledge that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the App. In the event of any failure of the App to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price, if any, for the App to you. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the App, and any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be solely governed by these Terms. You and Jelly acknowledge that Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims of yours or any third party relating to the App or your possession and/or use of the App, including, but not limited to: (a) product liability claims, (b) any claim that the App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement, and (c) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation. You and Jelly acknowledge that, in the event of any third party claim that the App or your possession and use of the App infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, Jelly, not Apple, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim to the extent required by these Terms. You must comply with applicable third-party terms of agreement when using the App. You and Jelly acknowledge and agree that Apple, and Apple’s subsidiaries, are third party beneficiaries of these Terms as they relate to your use of the App, and that, upon your acceptance of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as a third party beneficiary thereof.

## 23. **Governing Law**

These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Washington, United States, without regard to its conflict of law provisions or by the JAMS Rules in the case or arbitrations as outlined below.

## 24. **ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER**

Any dispute, controversy, or claim (collectively, “Claim”) relating in any way to your use of Jelly’s services and/or products, including the Service, will be resolved by arbitration. You and Jelly agree that any Claim will be settled by final and binding arbitration, using the English language, administered by JAMS under its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “JAMS Rules”) then in effect (those rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this section, and as of the date of these Terms). Arbitration will be handled by a sole arbitrator in accordance with the JAMS Rules. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court that has jurisdiction.

**Any arbitration under these Terms will take place on an individual basis – class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. You understand that by agreeing to these Terms, you and Jelly are each waiving the right to trial by jury or to participate in a class action or class arbitration.** Notwithstanding the foregoing, you and Jelly will have the right to bring an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable or conservatory relief, pending a final decision by the arbitrator. You may instead assert your claim in “small claims” court, but only if your claim qualifies, your claim remains in such court and your claim remains on an individual, non-representative and non-class basis.

Payment for any and all reasonable JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be in accordance with the JAMS Rules.

You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration provisions set forth in these Terms by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to [founders@jellypbc.com](mailto:founders@jellypbc.com) or to the U.S. mailing address listed at in the Contact Us section of these Terms. The notice must be sent to Jelly within thirty (30) days of your registering to use the Service or agreeing to these Terms, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with these Terms. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, Jelly also will not be bound by them.
