## **Information Sharing with Third Parties**

We may share your Personal Information outside Jelly in the following limited circumstances to which you consent:

**Service Providers:** We work with third party service providers to perform services on our behalf related to our Service. These third party service providers include, but are not limited to Stripe, Google, and their respective affiliates. We use these third party service providers in connection with the Service’s hosting infrastructure, payment processing, logon functionality, analytics related to the Service, marketing campaigns as described below, and customer service efforts. We may share your Personal Information with such service providers in connection with the procurement of such services. Please consult section “Links to Other Sites” below and the third party’s privacy policy for additional information.

**Marketing our Service:** We do not use or share your information, including Personal Information, to advertise any third party’s products or services via the Service. We may use and share your Personal Information with third party service providers to market our own Service and grow our Service’s user base, such as to provide targeted marketing about our own Service via third party platforms.

**Workspaces Accessible by Other Users:** As further explained in our Terms and Conditions, when you submit Personal Information in a workspace that can be accessed by others, such Personal Information may be displayed to other users in the same or connected workspaces. For example, your Personal Information may be included in your notes or reminders in a workspace which can be viewed by other users collaborating with you in that workspace. Further, your email address or photo may be displayed with your workspace profile to other users collaborating with you in that workspace.

**Enterprise Workspaces:** Jelly will share and disclose Enterprise Content in accordance with an Enterprise’s instructions, including any applicable terms in the Subscription Agreement and an Enterprise administrator’s use of Service’s administrative functionality, and in compliance with applicable law and legal process. We may also allow an Enterprise to access the profile information of Authorized Users, including to allow such Enterprise to validate that such Authorized User is actually authorized by such Enterprise to use the Service.

**Referral or Shared Content:** When you request our referral services to forward or share certain content with a friend, such as an email inviting a friend to use the Service or sharing certain content from the Service with a friend.

**Compliance With Law:** We will disclose your Personal Information where required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to comply with the law and the reasonable requests of law enforcement or to protect the security or integrity of our Service.

**Sale or Merger:** If we directly or indirectly undergo a business transition (including a proposed transaction), like a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or part our assets, we may disclose or transfer information collected from, and about, you (including your Personal Information), to the successor organization in (or in anticipation of) the transition.

## **Security**

The security of your Personal Information is important to us. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and we are unable to guarantee the absolute security of the Personal Information we have collected from you.

## **International Transfer**

Information collected while you use the Service, including your Personal Information, may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ than those from your jurisdiction. If you are located outside United States and choose to provide information to us, please note that we transfer the information, including your Personal Information, to United States and process it there.

Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such Personal Information represents your agreement to that transfer.

## **Links To Other Sites**

Our Service may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. Our inclusion of such links does not, by itself, imply any endorsement of the content on such platforms or of their owners or operators except as disclosed on the Service. Please keep in mind that information you post on public or semi-public venues, including information you share on third party social networking platforms (such as Facebook or Twitter) may also be viewable by other users of the Service and/or users of those third-party online platforms without limitation as to its use by us or by a third party. When you provide information to a third-party online platform, the information you provide may be separately collected by that third-party. The information the third-party online platform collects is subject to the third-party online platform’s privacy practices. Privacy choices you make on the third-party online platform will not apply to our use of the Information we collect directly through our Service. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.

We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services. We expressly disclaim any and all liability for the actions of third parties, including but without limitation to actions relating to the use and/or disclosure of Personal Information by third parties.

## **Children's Privacy**

We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from Children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you learn that your Children have provided us with Personal Information, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Information from a child under age 13 without verifiable parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information from our servers.

## **California Privacy Rights**

California residents that have an established business relationship with us can request a notice disclosing the categories of Personal Information we have shared with third parties during the preceding calendar year for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. To make such a request from us, if entitled, please use the contact information listed below.

If you are under 18 years of age and a California resident using the Service, at any time you can request that we remove content you have provided or posted. Please contact us at the information below for our assistance, including to request removal of your information or content. Note that the removal of information or content may not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of that information or content posted through the Service.

Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and Service that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and/or across different websites. If your browser is set to “Do Not Track”, we at Jelly will attempt to honor this functionality. However, as explained in the “Information Collection” section above, our third party service providers may use their own cookies, pixel tags, web beacons or other storage technology to collect and store Log Data or information from elsewhere on the internet, and we do not have access to, nor control over, a third parties’ use of cookies or other tracking technologies.

## **Changes To This Privacy Policy**

This Privacy Policy is effective as of the “LAST REVISED” date specified at the top of this Privacy Policy and will remain in effect except with respect to any changes in its provisions in the future, which will be in effect immediately after being posted on this page.

We reserve the right to update or change our Privacy Policy at any time and you should check this Privacy Policy periodically. Your continued use of the Service after we post any modifications to the Privacy Policy on this page will constitute your acknowledgment of the modifications and your consent to abide and be bound by the modified Privacy Policy.

If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you either through the email address you have provided us, and/or by placing a prominent notice on the Service.
